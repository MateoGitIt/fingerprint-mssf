This repository contains all the materials used in my project for the Maine State Science Fair. 

The Python files cross.py, analyze.py, and subtract.py open up traces from the Chrome, Firefox, and Safair folders and plot them using matplotlib.
The plots folder contains screenshots of preliminary (testing) and real (experimentally relevant) plots.
